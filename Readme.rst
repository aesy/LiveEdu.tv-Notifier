LiveEdu.tv Notifier
===================
A chrome extension that will display notifications when your favourite streamers on `LiveEdu.tv <https://www.LiveEdu.tv/>`_ go live!
You can also browse whatever else is available to watch.

Notice
------
Due to lack of external interest and LiveEdu.tvs' inability to maintain a stable API I have decided to take the extension down.
If you feel compelled to revive and maintain the project, I'll happily help you get started.

To-do
-----
* Show user avatar and stream language (not possible with liveedu.tvs' current API).
* Don't use bower
* Use Webpack instead of gulp
* Update dependencies

Issues
------
* Stream links direct to streamer profile instead of stream.
