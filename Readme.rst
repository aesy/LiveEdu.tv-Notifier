LiveCoding.tv Notifier
======================
This is a Chrome (and possibly future firefox) extension that will display notifications when your favourite streamers on `LiveCoding.tv <https://www.LiveCoding.tv/>`_ go live! You can also browse whatever else is being streamed.

NOTICE: I am waiting for LiveCoding to release a public API before putting this on the Chrome Web Store.
